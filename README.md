# Book Author Classifier
A Machine Learning implemented using Gaussian Multinomial to give a probability of who is the author of a book.

# Main Idea
Our goal is to create a table of probability of each word, based on the frequence of it in all books. This probability gives us an idea of how often such word appears in books from an specific author.
